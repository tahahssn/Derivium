# Derivium
**From Limits to 3D Graphs - Solve, Explore, Visualize**

Derivium is a modern **full-stack web application** designed to help students and educators **compute and visualize calculus concepts** interactively. It combines symbolic computation, dynamic equation rendering, smooth animations, and **2D/3D graph plotting** to create a powerful learning experience.
